# SnakeSoul

I created and developed an AI that masters the game of snake.

SnakeSoul always achieves the maximum length of the snake and performs up to 96% faster than other algorithms.

### Choose the difficulty

The next menu enables the player to choose the difficulty. A harder difficulty means that the size of each cell of the snake is smaller.

Before the game starts, another menu makes sure that the player knows the instructions he can use.
